              Fan conventions are busy places, with lots of events to go to and lots of people to see.  I wanted to help make the chaos a little more manageable by allowing people to plan things out in advance, and post information about themselves and where they were going.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took on all the front-end design and development myself, from CSS through JavaScript and into some of the Python controller code, with a great backend developer rounding out the team.  We put together the project on evenings and weekends, and launched at a convention with 3000 attendees in January 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have big plans for this project, with more conventions lined up for 2012 and 2013, and more folks coming together to fill out the features.  Our aim is to make an complete solution for all the web needs for small to medium-sized fandom conventions.

              These ads were created using the Adjitsu technology first developed at Cooliris and later acquired by A&bull;mo&bull;bee.  Our team created several of these ads for companies like BMW and Samsung.  I was involved in the design for many of these ads, and I wrote every ad myself, using an house-developed XML format.  Although the language was originally developed for static presentations, we tried to push the capabilities with each new ad, exceeding client expectations for exciting, innovative, and performant experiences.

              LiveShare is a mobile app by Cooliris centered around sharing photos at group events.  We wanted to include the ability for event staff to look through public photos and moderate them in real time, as well as feature some of the images on a Jumbotron or other large public display.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project, my team had to design and develop a very streamlined interface to allow very fast processing of images by a naive user who likely had a lot of other things to do at the same time (For instance, the AV staff at a concert).  We took an "Exception-based" approach to photo processing, assuming most images would be acceptable but not excellent, allowing the user to easily pass a large batch of images and move on to the next one.  Any images that needed special treatment (featuring or banning) could simply be dragged out of this group into large drop targets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system was sucessfully deployed at dozens of events, from KISS concerts to Stanford football games.  We were able to train users in the system in less than 15 minutes, and even new users were able to easily moderate events that generated hundreds of photos.

              When I joined up, Cooliris' main product was their 3D Wall browser plugin, which presented images in a smoothly-scrolling infinite 3D plane.  They also had a smaller Flash version of the same interface, which was intended to make it easy to show similar content embedded in a web page, but that product wasn't gaining much traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my longest-running projects at Cooliris was to design and implement a tool to give this tool a larger reach.  I created a web-based builder for those embedded walls, similar to the YouTube embed code generation, but allowing people to take external media sources, from YouTube or their own photos stored on Facebook, Picasa, or Flickr.  I led the design of this project as well as the implementation, integrating with all those different services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Packing all that design functionality into an easy interface was a very rewarding project.  Our target audience was bloggers and other web content creators, so we wanted to make sure it was customizable to fit with any web design, and also easy to embed on a wide variety of content platforms.  We went through several iterations, doing user testing for each one, until we came up with a smooth, compact interface that didn't compromise at all on features.

              The Holiday Card Creator was an iteration on the Cooliris Express concept, meant to simplify the interface, bringing a focus on personal images from casual computer users.  Our target here was families sharing photos for the holidays, and we aimed to make it easy for anyone with photos on the web to share them to even the least-tech-savvy of their relatives.  It was a great challenge to consider how to pare down an existing interface to focus on a different audience.

              Replicate Technologies was a small company producing virtual appliances for management of VMWare ESX servers.  I was hired to lead the development of a rich application-style web interface.  The app had to be able to configure analyses of VM environments and display detailed reports to users, showing them a side of their infrastructure they previously had little to no visibility into.</p>
            <p>
              I wrote all the front-end code on this project myself, but I'm even prouder of the design work I was able to do.  I got to work extensively with end-users and do some user tests, to make sure the interface was easy to set up and easy to understand.  I also designed many of the data visualizations for the reports themselves, collecting sometimes hundreds of data points into overviews that fit on a single screen but still allowed easy drill-down to a detailed view.
